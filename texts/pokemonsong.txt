I want to be the very best,
Like no one ever was.
To catch them is my real test,
To train them is my cause!
I will travel across the land,
Searching far and wide.
Each Pokemon to understand
The power that's inside!
Pokemon!
Gotta catch em' all!
It's you and me,
I know it's my destiny!
Pokemon!
Oh, you're my best friend,
In a world we must defend!
Pokemon!
Gotta catch em' all!
A heart so true,
Our courage will pull us through!
You teach me and I'll teach you,
Po-ke-mon!
Gotta catch em' all!
Gotta catch em' all!
Po-ke-mon!
